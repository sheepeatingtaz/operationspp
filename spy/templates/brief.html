    <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>
    <p>Calling all spies and wannabe secret agents! We need your help to find the secret code hidden in and around Goole
        to prevent the demolition of our beloved water towers by an underground organised crime group.</p>

    <p>The walk covers roughly 3.5 miles and is suitable for pushchairs. Expect it to take 1.5 â€“ 2 hours, depending on how
        well you know Goole! It is mainly set on flat footpaths so normal walking shoes are fine. It is also dog
        friendly, although smaller dogs may appreciate being carried over the foot bridge on the docks rather than
        walking across the metal grid!</p>

    <p>Free parking is available at East Riding Leisure in Goole, adjacent to the Jobcentre Plus. The address is North
        Street, Goole, East Yorkshire, United Kingdom, DN14 5QB.<a class="btn btn-success btn-small" target="_blank"

    <p>The code is 24 digits (letters & numbers) and the app will store your answers.</p>
    <p>Please add photos of your walk to the Facebook page for us all to enjoy.</p>
